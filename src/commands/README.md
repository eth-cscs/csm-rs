# Introduction

These are functions that matches 1 to 1 with manta operations, these functions are related to CSM and not provided by OCHAMI to simplify the software development.

## Why we did this?

Because manta cli needs many capabilities that OCHAMI does not provide, and we need to have a way to use manta cli without having to implement all the capabilities in OCHAMI.
